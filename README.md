## Additional Tips

* **Use headings:** Structure your content with clear headings (e.g., `#`, `##`, `###`).
* **Add images:** Enhance your README with relevant images using `![alt text](image.png)`.
* **Create links:** Link to external resources or other parts of your README using `[link text](url)`.
* **Format code:** Use backticks for inline code (`code`) and triple backticks for code blocks (```code```).
* **Leverage tables:** Organize information in tables using Markdown syntax.
* **Consider a TOC:** For longer READMEs, generate a table of contents using tools or manually.

**Example of a code block:**
```python
def calculate_data_quality(data):
  # Code for calculating data quality
  pass
